Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.  \n(Source:  Readme.txt of the original UCI HAR dataset   \n more info on  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones )  \n\n## Transformations & cleaning\n\n- Data was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, which was unzipped to working directory.\n\n- Train and Test sets were read using the variable names aka features provided in features.txt  \n\n- Addtional variables Subject and Activity were added to Train and Test respectively. Reasonable assumption is that order of Subject (subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt) and Activity (from y_train.txt and y_test.txt) variables was the same as the one in the X_Train.txt and X_Test.txt containing the actual data sets.  \n\n- Train and Test data sets were merged  \n\n- Activity variable was replaced by descriptive data label from activity_labels.txt  \n\n- Only std and mean variables were kept, and grouped by Subject and Activity.\n\n- The mean was taken over that grouping.\n\n",
